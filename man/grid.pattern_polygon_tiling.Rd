\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector or unit object specifying x-locations of the pattern boundary.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector or unit object specifying y-locations of the pattern boundary.}

\item{id}{A numeric vector used to separate locations in x, y into multiple boundaries.
All locations within the same \code{id} belong to the same boundary.}

\item{...}{Currently ignored.}

\item{colour}{Stroke colour(s).}

\item{fill}{Fill colour(s) or \code{\link[grid:patterns]{grid::pattern()}} / gradient object(s).}

\item{angle}{Rotation angle in degrees.}

\item{spacing}{Spacing between repetitions of pattern (in \code{units} units).}

\item{xoffset}{Shift pattern along x axis (in \code{units} units).}

\item{yoffset}{Shift pattern along y axis (in \code{units} units).}

\item{units}{\code{\link[grid:unit]{grid::unit()}} units for \code{spacing}, \code{xoffset}, and \code{yoffset} parameters.}

\item{type}{Name of polygon tiling to draw.  See Details.}

\item{alpha}{Alpha (between 0 and 1) or \code{NA} (default, preserves colors' alpha value).
Not supported for all polygon tiling \code{type}.}

\item{linetype}{Stroke linetype.}

\item{linewidth}{Stroke linewidth.}

\item{size}{For backwards compatibility can be used to set \code{linewidth}.}

\item{default.units}{A string indicating the default units to use if \code{x} or \code{y}
are only given as numeric vectors.}

\item{name}{ A character identifier. }

\item{gp}{An object of class \code{"gpar"}, typically the output
    from a call to the function \code{\link[grid]{gpar}}.  This is basically
    a list of graphical parameter settings.}

\item{draw}{A logical value indicating whether graphics output
    should be produced.}

\item{vp}{A Grid viewport object (or NULL).}
}
\value{
A grid grob object invisibly.  If \code{draw} is \code{TRUE} then also draws to the graphic device as a side effect.
}
\description{
\code{grid.pattern_polygon_tiling()} draws a specified polygon tiling pattern onto the graphic device.
\code{names_polygon_tiling} lists all supported types.
}
\details{
\code{grid.pattern_polygon_tiling()} supports 1, 2, or 3 \code{fill} colors with the first colors (weakly)
covering a larger area.  Size of the pattern is controlled by \code{spacing}.
